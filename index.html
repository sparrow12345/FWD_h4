              <h3>Movie Website Interface                                                 /Jul, 2022/</h3>
              <p>
                The main goal of this project was to showcase what I learned about React JS in the first few weeks. This project
                features a movie website interface that I have built from scratch.

              <h3>Recommendation System - Recommending best games from user history       /Apr, 2022/</h3>
              <p>The main goal of this project was to build a recommendation system that builds personalized game
                recommendations for a closed set of users (in this task, we assume that the user database will not receive new
                elements later on). The model built uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to achieve the task at hand.
              </p>
              <p>This project was a test task for my internship in Data Science (added in the next section).</p>

              <h3>Game Developer | Internship      June 2021 – July 2021</h3>
              <p>
                Worked under the umbrella topic “Fun with Formal Methods”, the goal of which was to find more fun ways to teach
                basic mathematical concepts needed for IT Specialists.</p>
              <p>Implemented a small-size entertaining finite-position game borrowed from Math contests to engage people with
                the background part of game theory, Finite Positional Analysis in particular.</p>

              <h3>Data Scientist | Internship      June 2022 – July 2022</h3>
              <p>The goal of this internship was to build a model that predicts a student’s success or failure in a particular college
                course, taking into account the student’s grade history and the course characteristics and prerequisites.
              </p>
              <p>My role was in Data Extraction and Preprocessing. I used BeautifulSoup library to scrape the data we need from
                our university’s EduWiki website. After that, I processed the data so that it could be used to build the ML model.</p>
